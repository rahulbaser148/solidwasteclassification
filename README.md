# Solid Waste Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for an intelligent solid waste classification system developed using deep learning techniques. The project aims to accurately classify waste into nine distinct classes, including aluminum, glass, paper and cardboard, wood, textiles, plastic, other plastic, organic and carton. And further categorize waste into organic and inorganic components.

## Overview

Improper waste management poses severe environmental and health risks, contributing to pollution, resource depletion, and ecological degradation. This project leverages the power of deep learning and computer vision to provide an efficient and automated solution for waste classification, promoting better waste management practices and effective recycling.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: The project utilizes two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, ResNet152 and VGG19, which have demonstrated exceptional performance in computer vision tasks.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models on the ImageNet dataset are fine-tuned on a diverse dataset of waste images, leveraging the knowledge gained from training on a large-scale dataset.
- **Multi-class Classification**: The system can classify waste into nine distinct classes, including aluminum, glass, paper and cardboard, wood, textiles, plastic, other plastic, organic and carton.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A Flask-based web application with a user-friendly interface allows users to upload or capture images of waste for classification.
- **Waste Information**: After classification, the system provides additional information about the classified waste material, including its environmental impact and recommended disposal or recycling methods.

## Repository Structure

- `model/`: Contains the pre-trained ResNet152 and VGG19 models.
- `app.py`: The Python file for the Flask web application.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/`: Directory for static files (images).
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages and dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/solid-waste-classification.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
4. Access the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Visit the web application in your browser.
2. Choose either the "Upload Image" or "Capture Image" option to provide an image of waste.
3. The system will process the image through the ResNet152 or VGG19 model and display the predicted waste category.
4. Additional information about the classified waste material, including its environmental impact and recommended disposal or recycling methods, will be provided.
